#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I’m an AI research scientist at **Meta Superintelligence Labs**. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Toronto. where I was advised by Yang Xu. 

My current research centers on **multimodal AI agent systems** powered by **large language models**. I explore how these agents can **reason, memorize, plan, and act** for real-world tasks, and how they could adaptively infer and fulfill user needs. My research draws on techniques such as **reinforcement learning, memory-augmented generation, and world models**.

I’m also committed to making AI **reliable and transparent**. I have designed algorithms and tools that improve the **interpretability, safety, and trustworthiness** of large language models. I’m currently focused on understanding how large language models acquire world knowledge and reasoning capability from vast amounts of data during pre-training and post-training. 


During my PhD, I studied automated understanding and generation of creative language use, and I was fortunate to intern at Meta FAIR and Google Research.
